What is Arc?
===
Arc is a Pythagorean plotter that uses arduino uC to control the motors that pull the strings (adjusting the hypotenues) at correct speed to move from point A to point B. Java is used as a gcode enterpreter to automate the process of sending commands one after another to draw large images using gcode.
